Hey, I'm Bigfootmech

### Game Jams
The concept of imperfection, and hard time limits appeals to me

It feels like a good way to improve without worrying too much

Hence, every now and then I'll tackle a game jam, focusing on a specific aspect or another, to try to get better.

Plus I can have a reminder for the future of how far I've come :)

If we're in the same Discord or something, hit me up to jam together!

### Currently working on
To replace a weight-loss spreadsheet that didn't quite work smoothly, and started crashing, I'm currently re-working it in to a custom piece of software.

Godot frontend, because I found it easy to work with for game jams. 
C# backend, because I wanted to extend my Java knowledge to a new language.
Set up like a web api, with autowiring, and sqlite storage. To kind of copy what I already know of, and understand how and why those work. As well as the C# build system.

### Proudest Accomplishment
My favourite thing I've done so far is probably my Dragon Train mod (on Steam workshop, and video on YT).
Took about 2 weeks of hacking a Chinese IL2CPP game. And the effect is more or less exactly what I wanted.
I still laugh whenever I see the video.

(the game originally has a dragon that comes on screen, and roar. replaced it with a train + HOOONK!)

### History
Been around the internet since the early 2000's

I've made some Flash games, and a website with Bionicle font that is now lost to time. 
Past that, there's actually some records on an old Steam Talk page of my adventures (link left).
The current profile picture was actually made by me in paint when I was ~13 years old, and I treasure its sentimentality.
